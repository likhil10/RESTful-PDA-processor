# PushdownAutomaton

In the previous project (https://github.com/likhil10/PushDown-Automata-for-0-n1-n), We implemented a simulator for PDAs. The simulator is effectively a processor of
PDA “programs”. We will call the simulator a PDA processor. In this project, we will implement a
RESTful API in GoLang for a client-server for the PDA processor. The implementation will manage PDA
programs for a PDA processor.
